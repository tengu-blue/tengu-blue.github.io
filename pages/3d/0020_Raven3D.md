<h1> The Raven animations </h1>
<p>
For the <a href="../projects/0001_raven.html">Raven project</a> I had to create several animations in Blender using freely available 3D models, materials and textures.

    The entire game takes place inside a singular room. As such, all animations take place in this one scene. For optimization and to make the iterative process better, I duped the scene multiple times, with certain objects removed or hidden if they were not needed. I made the room myself and filled it with various objects that suited the setting.

<p>
    The final renders were done using EEVEE, if we had had more time we probably could have achieved slightly better results using a pathtracing pipeline instead.

As the used assets are not my own, credits are in order and this is the place for it: <a href="0000_credits.html">credits</a>.
