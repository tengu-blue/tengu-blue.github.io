    I like to take part in game jams hosted by MFF. I like to challenge myself to see what I can come up with in limited time.

None of these are exactly stellar projects, but that is to be expected from time-limited endeavors like this.

I like to use freely available assets - sprites mostly. I mainly work with Godot.
