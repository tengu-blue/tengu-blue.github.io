project_description: |
    A school project with the goal of working in a small team using the proprietary Charles Games Full-motion video game engine. Our team chose to adapt "The Raven", a poem by Edgar Allan Poe.

    Instead of recording videos for the game, we chose to create our videos via Blender animations fully 3D. I worked on adapting the source material for the game, and creating the animations.

    I used freely available 3D models, materials and textures. I did the scene layout, rigging, lighting and animations by myself to suit the script outline as best as possible.

project_postmortem: |
    The main issue with the project was lack of time for iteration. Granted, that was not really the point of the assignment. If we could, seeing the final result, we would have adjusted certain aspects. 
    
    For example, the game could be more interactive. We opted for fewer interactions, as we did not want to break the flow of the poem too much. As it is right now, the speaking parts are too long in places. The poem could have been shortened to speed up those sections whilst keeping the overall experience.

    The main goal was to supply an atmospheric retelling of the poem, which was overall successful.

Since the project was made using a proprietary piece of software, I will not be providing links to the actual project repo or the actual game. I will provide a link to a video with the full playthrough.
