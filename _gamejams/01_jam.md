My interpretation of the theme was to come up with a fun mechanic that would revolve around things in the game changing due to player's actions. Eventually, I settled on the idea of time rewinding mechanic used to solve puzzles - a 2D platformer game. 

I think most people didn't interpret the theme the same way I did. Overall, I was happy about the final product, although from the feedback I got, the player controller was not the most ideal. For this being my first ever game jam that I took part in, I think it was a great learning experience.
