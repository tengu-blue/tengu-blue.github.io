For this jam I decided to focus more on the narrative side. The gameplay is very simple, the writing was my real focus.

I think it came out alright, but maybe was a little too difficult in places, which maybe meant that not everyone got the experience I wanted. Additionally, I think my reading of the theme this time was very tenuous.

I figured a narrative experience about a character who is scared to ask for help would be interesting and relatable. The idea being that asking for help - being brave and bold - would bring happiness - fortune. I think most people didn't get it, which is fair.
