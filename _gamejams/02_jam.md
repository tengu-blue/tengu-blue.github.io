This was my second game jam that I took part in, using knowledge from the previous one. I went with a simpler design in terms of gameplay and visuals. 

For the theme I chose to depict the inevitable downfall of every modern day influencer - a satirical approach. I tried my hand at a more comical approach which I think resonated with people more.
